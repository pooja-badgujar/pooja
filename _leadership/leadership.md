## 🏆 Hult Prize Global Innovation Platform  

As part of the **Hult Prize**, known as the *“Nobel Prize for students”*, I co-founded a venture that empowers women in rural India through sustainable entrepreneurship.  
Our model transformed locally sourced materials into **eco-friendly products**, providing economic independence to women while connecting their craftsmanship to **global markets in Taiwan**.  

This initiative wasn’t just a social mission — it was a **scalable business solution**, tackling real-world challenges through innovation, supply-chain design, and impact-driven thinking.  
Our approach earned **first place at the university level (National Dong Hwa University)** and the chance to represent Taiwan at the **regional finals in Vietnam**, pitching our vision to international investors and industry leaders.
