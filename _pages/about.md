Hi, I’m **Pooja Manik Badgujar**, a scientist, dreamer, and storyteller of life’s hidden codes.  
I grew up curious about how life begins, heals, and transforms.  
I began my journey in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, working with IBM (Bangalore) and the Optical Energy Conversion Laboratory (Taiwan) on semiconductors, where I learned how the smallest building blocks could create immense possibilities.

Yet, my curiosity pulled me further from circuits to cells.  
That curiosity led me to pursue a Ph.D. in Biophysics, where I discovered that molecules, such as carotenoids, carry not just colors but also stories.  
Stories about regeneration, resilience, and the evolution of life itself.  

In my work, I use Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging (2P-FLIM), and molecular analysis to study how life builds itself:  
- How a tiny segmented worm regenerates lost body parts.  
- How snowflake yeast evolves multicellularity from single cells.  
- How molecules like carotenoids act as both protectors and signals across systems from amoeba to zebrafish to *Daucus Carota* (Orange carrots).  

But science, for me, is more than lab work.  
It’s about curiosity, connection, and creativity.  
I’ve shared my journey through online expo talks on Taiwan Career and Higher Education, mentored students, collaborated with international teams, and even rebuilt my lab after an earthquake.  
These experiences taught me resilience, teamwork, and the joy of creating something meaningful out of challenges.

I believe science is a universal language, one that connects regeneration in a worm to the potential for regeneration in humans, and even to the search for life on other worlds.
