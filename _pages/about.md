If you're short on time, this video provides a concise look at my key work and long-term goals:[YT Video](https://youtu.be/bJqNj6T2dq4?feature=shared)  

Hi, I‚Äôm **Dr. Pooja Manik Badgujar**, a scientist, dreamer, and storyteller of life‚Äôs hidden codes. I grew up curious about how life begins, heals, and transforms. I began my journey in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, working with IBM (Bangalore, India) and the Optical Energy Conversion Laboratory (Hualien, Taiwan) on semiconductors, where I learned how the smallest building blocks could create immense possibilities.  

Yet, my curiosity pulled me further from circuits to cells. That curiosity led me to pursue a Ph.D. in Biophysics at the InfraRed Laboratory (Hualien, Taiwan), where I discovered that molecules, such as carotenoids, carry not just colors but also stories. Stories about regeneration, resilience, and the evolution of life itself.

Under the mentorship of [Prof. Chia-Liang Cheng](https://faculty.ndhu.edu.tw/~clcheng/clcheng.htm), whose academic lineage traces back to Taiwan‚Äôs first Nobel laureate-trained scholars, **Yuan T. Lee**, I honed my skills in Two-Photon Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (2P-FLIM) and Raman spectroscopy. This training shaped my approach to science, blending precision physics with biological complexity and laying the groundwork for my work on regeneration, molecular signatures, and the origins of multicellularity.  

In my work, I use Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging (2P-FLIM), and molecular analysis to study how life builds itself:  
- How a tiny segmented worm regenerates lost body parts.  
- How snowflake yeast evolves multicellularity from single cells.  
- How molecules like carotenoids act as both protectors and signals across systems from amoeba to zebrafish to *Daucus Carota* (Orange carrots).  

But science, for me, is more than lab work. It‚Äôs about curiosity, connection, and creativity. I‚Äôve shared my journey through online expo talks on Taiwan Career and Higher Education, mentored students, collaborated with international teams, and even rebuilt my lab after an earthquake. These experiences taught me resilience, teamwork, and the joy of creating something meaningful out of challenges.  


Outside the lab, you‚Äôll find me:

**üç≤ Cooking with heart and experimenting with flavors**  
*Carrots, Cooking & Carotenoids*

</p>

When I cook carrots, I‚Äôm not just playing with flavors; I‚Äôm also seeing molecules at work. Carotenoids (like Œ≤-carotene, which makes carrots orange) change their bioavailability depending on how you cook them: boiling, steaming, or adding oil helps release them so our bodies can absorb more.  

In my research, I study carotenoids as molecular storytellers: they act as antioxidants and as signals during regeneration and multicellularity. Just like cooking reveals their hidden nutritional power, my spectroscopy work reveals their hidden biological roles guiding stem cells, regulating redox states, and influencing how life heals or evolves.  

So in both the kitchen and the lab, carotenoids connect flavor, color, and vitality with the deeper story of life‚Äôs resilience and transformation. ‚ÄúFrom snowflake yeast to regenerating worms, my research follows Darwin‚Äôs idea of survival of the fittest, where only the most adaptable molecular strategies endure.‚Äù  

**üöÄ Dreaming big about contributing to the future of astrobiology**

</p>

From carotenoids as molecular signals in amoeba, zebrafish, and carrots, to the emergence of cooperative behavior in snowflake yeast, my research connects molecular fingerprints to some of life‚Äôs deepest questions:  

- **How do organisms regenerate?**  
- **How did multicellularity evolve?**
- **Can universal biosignatures guide us in regenerative medicine and even astrobiology?**  

I am a biophysicist decoding the molecular signatures of life through advanced optical imaging. My work integrates Two-Photon Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (phasor approach) and Raman spectroscopy to map cellular processes in vivo, revealing how carotenoids, redox states, and lipid metabolism regulate regeneration, development, and multicellularity. From identifying blastema formation in the regenerating worm *Aeolosoma viride* to tracking cooperative transitions in snowflake yeast, my research connects biophysics and evolutionary biology to address fundamental questions: how life heals, organizes, and evolves complexity.  

My vision is to establish **label-free optical assays** as **universal tools** for studying **regeneration and the origins of life**, bridging model organisms, human health, and astrobiology.  

I believe science is a universal language, one that connects regeneration in a worm to the potential for regeneration in humans, and even to the search for life on other worlds. Decoding Life, Light, and Evolution.
