‚ÄúFrom ancient carotenoid signatures in *Daucus carota* to their role in regeneration, this award-winning work explores how molecular vibrations trace the story of life ‚Äî a story first heard at **1604 cm‚Åª¬π Raman signature of Life**.‚Äù

üèÜ **Excellent Poster Award ‚Äì TISRS Raman International Conference and TARS Summer Camp (Taiwan, 2019)**  

One of the most formative moments of my early scientific career was receiving the Excellent Poster Award from Prof. Hiro-o Hamaguchi, one of the world‚Äôs leading pioneers in Raman spectroscopy. Prof. Hamaguchi‚Äôs seminal discovery of the Raman spectral signature of life at 1604 cm‚Åª¬π from budding yeast laid the foundation for exploring how vibrational fingerprints reveal biological complexity.  

My awarded work focused on the Raman spectroscopic signature of carotenoids in *Daucus carota* (carrot), a system whose evolutionary history offers a powerful context for decoding the biochemical language of life. Carotenoids are ancient molecules, and their presence in *Daucus carota*, one of the most evolutionarily refined plant systems, provides an ideal model to investigate how molecular signatures have adapted and diversified over time.  

By studying these signatures in such a deeply evolved species, we gain a clearer understanding of carotenoid dynamics across biological systems ‚Äî knowledge that can then be applied to more complex organisms and regenerative contexts.

Receiving this recognition from Prof. Hamaguchi, the scientist who first listened to life‚Äôs molecular vibrations, was an honor that profoundly shaped my research vision.
