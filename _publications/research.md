## Research & Publications  

My research journey is guided by a single question: **How do molecules shape life’s most profound transitions from regeneration to multicellularity?** 

Each paper I’ve written is a chapter in my ongoing exploration of life’s hidden language—how molecules signal, organize, and evolve to build complexity. From decoding the molecular whispers of regeneration to mapping the bioenergetic shifts that drive multicellularity, my work integrates advanced optical spectroscopy, Raman analysis, and fluorescence lifetime imaging to reveal stories beneath the microscope.

### Regeneration & Redox signaling (in vivo, label-free)  

I pioneered the use of Raman spectroscopy combined with Two-Photon Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (2P-FLIM) to study regeneration in the segmented worm *Aeolosoma viride*.  

By separating blastemal cells from lipid droplets based on their unique lifetimes, I revealed how carotenoids regulate tissue repair through their antioxidant and signaling roles.  

This work established *Aeolosoma* as a powerful, simplified model for regeneration, paving the way for applications in human biology.

**Key contribution:** Defined optical biomarkers for real-time, label-free regenerative monitoring.

### Molecular evolution of multicellularity (Snowflake yeast)  

Using snowflake yeast as an experimental evolution model, I investigate how single cells evolve cooperation, adhesion, and division of labor.  
By applying optical tools and Raman spectroscopy, I study the bioenergetics and redox signaling underlying the transition to multicellularity.

This work addresses one of life’s most fundamental questions: how do autonomous cells become an integrated organism?

### Carotenoids as a Life signature across states  

Carotenoid dynamics from plant seeds (β-carotene, lutein) to zebrafish larvae (astaxanthin) and invertebrate regeneration map antioxidant vs signaling roles across contexts.  Carotenoids are conserved cross-platform biomarkers of development, stress response, and regeneration, with potential translatability to mammalian neurodevelopment and retinal metabolism.

</div>  

Carotenoids are more than pigments; they are molecular signatures of life’s transitions.  
I have observed them in:  
- *Amoeba*, where they mark dormancy and encystment.  
- *Zebrafish larvae*, where astaxanthin appears during early development.  
- *Carrot evolution*, where β-carotene signals root differentiation.
