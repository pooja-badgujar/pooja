My research journey is guided by a single question: **how do molecules shape lifeâ€™s most profound transitions from regeneration to multicellularity?**  
Each paper Iâ€™ve written is a chapter in this ongoing exploration of lifeâ€™s hidden language â€” how molecules signal, organize, and evolve to build complexity.  

From decoding the molecular whispers of regeneration to mapping the bioenergetic shifts that drive multicellularity, my work integrates advanced **optical spectroscopy, Raman analysis, and fluorescence lifetime imaging** to reveal stories beneath the microscope.

## Regeneration & Redox Signaling *(in vivo, label-free)*  

I pioneered the use of **Raman spectroscopy** combined with **Two-Photon Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (2P-FLIM)** to study regeneration in the segmented worm *Aeolosoma viride*.  

- **Key finding:** blastemal cells can be separated from lipid droplets based on unique lifetimes.  
- **Insight:** carotenoids regulate tissue repair through antioxidant and signaling roles.  
- **Impact:** established *Aeolosoma* as a simplified model for regeneration, paving the way for applications in human biology.

## Molecular Evolution of Multicellularity *(Snowflake yeast)*  

Using snowflake yeast as an experimental evolution model, I explore how single cells evolve **cooperation, adhesion, and division of labor.**  

- **Approach:** Raman spectroscopy + optical bioenergetics  
- **Goal:** uncover molecular/redox drivers of multicellularity  
- **Relevance:** connects evolutionary biology, biosignatures (astrobiology), and collective systems engineering.

## Carotenoids as Life Signatures Across Systems  

Carotenoids are more than pigments â€” they are **molecular storytellers of lifeâ€™s transitions.**  

- **Amoeba:** markers of dormancy & encystment  
- **Zebrafish larvae:** astaxanthin signals early development  
- **Carrots:** Î²-carotene drives root differentiation  

Across systems, carotenoids act as conserved **biomarkers of metabolism, redox balance, and development**, with potential for regeneration, neurobiology, and astrobiology.

# Research Vision  

Each publication is not just a result â€” itâ€™s a **step toward understanding lifeâ€™s universal patterns.**  
My work bridges **regenerative medicine, astrobiology, and evolutionary biology**, guided by one aim:  
ðŸ‘‰ to establish **label-free optical assays** as universal tools for studying regeneration, multicellularity, and the origins of life.
