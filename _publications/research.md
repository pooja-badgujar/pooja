My research journey is guided by a single question: **How do molecules shape life‚Äôs most profound transitions from regeneration to multicellularity?** Each paper I‚Äôve written is a chapter in my ongoing exploration of life‚Äôs hidden language‚Äîhow molecules signal, organize, and evolve to build complexity. From decoding the molecular whispers of regeneration to mapping the bioenergetic shifts that drive multicellularity, my work integrates advanced optical spectroscopy, Raman analysis, and fluorescence lifetime imaging to reveal stories beneath the microscope.

### Regeneration & Redox signaling (in vivo, label-free)  

I pioneered the use of Raman spectroscopy combined with Two-Photon Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (2P-FLIM) to study regeneration in the segmented worm *Aeolosoma viride*.  By separating blastemal cells from lipid droplets based on their unique lifetimes, I revealed how carotenoids regulate tissue repair through their antioxidant and signaling roles. This work established *Aeolosoma* as a powerful, simplified model for regeneration, paving the way for applications in human biology.

**Key contribution:** Defined optical biomarkers for real-time, label-free regenerative monitoring.

### Molecular evolution of multicellularity (Snowflake yeast)  

Using snowflake yeast as an experimental evolution model, I investigate how single cells evolve cooperation, adhesion, and division of labor. By applying optical tools and Raman spectroscopy, I study the bioenergetics and redox signaling underlying the transition to multicellularity.

This work addresses one of life‚Äôs most fundamental questions: how do autonomous cells become an integrated organism?

### Carotenoids as a Life signature across states  

Carotenoid dynamics from plant seeds (Œ≤-carotene, lutein) to zebrafish larvae (astaxanthin) and invertebrate regeneration map antioxidant vs signaling roles across contexts.  Carotenoids are conserved cross-platform biomarkers of development, stress response, and regeneration, with potential translatability to mammalian neurodevelopment and retinal metabolism.

</div>  

Carotenoids are more than pigments; they are molecular signatures of life‚Äôs transitions.  
I have observed them in:  
- *Amoeba*, where they mark dormancy and encystment.  
- *Zebrafish larvae*, where astaxanthin appears during early development.  
- *Carrot evolution*, where Œ≤-carotene signals root differentiation.

### Beyond the Microscope

**‚ÄúBecause Discovery doesn't stop at the microscope‚Äù**

Outside the lab, I‚Äôm still searching for life‚Äôs beauty in coral reefs beneath the waves, in the quiet patience of a garden, in the alchemy of a home-cooked meal, and in stories shared with friends and strangers alike. Whether I‚Äôm teaching, mentoring, kayaking, or capturing the world through a camera lens, curiosity continues to guide me. Ultimately, my science is about more than understanding; it‚Äôs about **belonging**. Because every discovery, from a single cell‚Äôs spark to the evolution of complexity, reminds me that life‚Äôs story is also ours.  

Science may be my compass, but curiosity guides every part of my life. When I‚Äôm not decoding the molecular language of life, you‚Äôll likely find me chasing sunlight in other ways, exploring coral reefs beneath the waves, hiking misty trails, diving beneath turquoise waves, hiking quiet mountain trails, or photographing the world through a different kind of lens. My love for cooking is more than a hobby; it‚Äôs chemistry in the kitchen, where molecules become flavor and tradition becomes innovation. I also have a soft spot for cats and dogs, whose playful curiosity often reminds me why I fell in love with science in the first place. My love for animals, spontaneous travels, and storytelling through photography keeps me grounded and reminds me that science, too, is a story we‚Äôre all part of.
