Science thrives on dialogue. Presenting my work and engaging with the global scientific community at prestigious international conferences, including **IUPAB** and **ICORS**, as well as regional symposia across Asia, has sparked new collaborations. From international conferences to invited lectures, each talk reflects my mission to connect **fundamental biophysics** with **big-picture questions in evolution and regeneration**.
